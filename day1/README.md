# CUDA Vector Addition

This project is a learning exercise focused on **CUDA-based vector addition** while understanding **parallel programming concepts**. The implementation follows the book **"Programming Massively Parallel Processors (PMPP)"** as a guide.

## üöÄ **Day 1 Progress**

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Learning C++ Basics**

* Reviewed fundamental C++ concepts, including memory management and pointers.

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Understanding Memory Allocation in CPU and GPU**

* Explored the differences between **host (CPU) memory allocation** and **device (GPU) memory allocation**.
* Practiced memory allocation using `cudaMalloc()` and `cudaFree()`.

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Grid, Thread, and Block Concepts**

* Gained an understanding of **thread hierarchy in CUDA**.
* Learned how **blocks and threads** are mapped in a **grid structure**.
* Implemented a simple CUDA kernel to apply these concepts in practice.

### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Followed PMPP Book for Reference**

* The implementation was developed while following **"Programming Massively Parallel Processors (PMPP)"**.
* Studied CUDA programming fundamentals and best practices.
