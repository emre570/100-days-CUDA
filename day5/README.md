# **CUDA Memory Architecture and Performance Optimization**

## **1. Memory Hierarchy and Data Locality**
We discussed the different memory types in CUDA and how they impact performance:
- **Registers:** Fastest but limited in size, used per thread.
- **Local Memory:** Private to a thread but stored in global memory, causing latency.
- **Shared Memory:** Block-level memory, much faster than global memory.
- **Global Memory:** Large but slow; requires memory coalescing for optimal performance.
- **Constant Memory:** Read-only, cached memory for broadcasting small values.

### **Key Takeaways:**
- Reducing global memory accesses improves performance.
- Shared memory is ideal for data reuse within a block.
- Proper tiling and coalescing strategies significantly reduce memory bottlenecks.

## **2. Tiling and Matrix Multiplication Optimization**
Tiling is used to load smaller matrix blocks into **shared memory** to reduce global memory access.

### **Matrix Multiplication Implementation**
- **Global Memory Access Reduction:** Each tile is loaded once, reused multiple times.
- **Thread Collaboration:** Threads within a block load different parts of the tile and compute partial results.
- **Synchronization:** `__syncthreads()` ensures correct execution order.

## **3. Performance Analysis and Optimization**
### **Initial Performance Testing**
We started with a basic tiled matrix multiplication kernel and measured its execution time and performance (TFLOP/s).

### **Tile Width Optimization**
| **Tile Width** | **Execution Time (ms)** | **TFLOP/s** |
|--------------|------------------|-------------|
| 16          | 1.39104           | 1.54        |
| 32          | 0.49952           | 4.30        |
| 64          | 0.265408          | 8.09        |

**Observation:** Increasing tile width improved memory coalescing, reducing execution time and increasing TFLOP/s.

### **Block Size Optimization**
| **Block Size** | **Execution Time (ms)** | **TFLOP/s** |
|--------------|------------------|-------------|
| (16,16)      | Higher            | Lower       |
| (32,32)      | Lower             | Higher      |

**Observation:** The best performance was achieved with (32,32) block size, balancing parallelism and memory efficiency.

### **Best Performance Achieved**
| **Matrix Size (m, n, p)** | **Tile Width** | **Block Size** | **Execution Time (ms)** | **TFLOP/s** |
|-------------------|------------|------------|----------------------|------------------|
| 128, 24576, 1536 | 64         | 32, 32     | 1.40144              | 6.89            |
| 4096, 32768, 512 | 64         | 32, 32     | 17.48                | 7.86            |

### **Performance Bottlenecks and Limitations**
We identified potential bottlenecks affecting CUDA performance:
1. **Memory Bandwidth:** Higher tile widths improved memory efficiency.
2. **Compute Utilization:** The best performance was near the theoretical TFLOP/s limit of RTX 3070 Ti.
3. **VRAM Limitations:** Large matrices exceeded the 8GB memory limit, causing execution failures.
4. **CUDA Error Handling:** Detecting `cudaMalloc()` failures helped debug memory allocation issues.

## **Conclusion**
- **Memory management is critical** for optimizing CUDA performance.
- **Tiling and shared memory usage** drastically improve matrix multiplication efficiency.
- **Tile width and block size tuning** are essential for achieving optimal performance.
- **Understanding VRAM limitations** is crucial when working with large matrices.
