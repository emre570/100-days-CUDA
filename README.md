# CUDA 100-Day Challenge

## ðŸš€ My Motivation

This has been on my mind for weeks. I wanted to gather resources, but I kept doing nothing. Then, I saw Umar's tweet, and that spark lit a fire in my head. I just needed to start from somewhereâ€”the rest will follow. I will commit to this with **discipline**, even on days I don't feel like it. I will **push my willpower to the limit** and make progress every day.
